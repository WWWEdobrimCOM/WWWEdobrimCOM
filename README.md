Hello my name is Edoardo, I was born in 1988, as a hobby in addition to martial arts, meditation and sports I do coding. 
I learned self-taught and with books... visual basic net and a bit of Python and php.
I also learned web security.
I have created a very useful program called EdoBrimCrypter that can be downloaded from my site(edobrim.com) or other sites.
Sometimes I like to make MODs for video games.
I created a mod for Age of empires 3 called Equilibrium mod and a mod for Ikemen Go called EdoMugem.
